# Challenge 01

# Description

* This challenge was to refactor HTML and CSS code for the website "Horiseon" to become more accessible. The end result of these changes was to organize and correct the HTML & CSS files without changing the appearance or structure of the webpage.

# Changelog

* Changed title from "website" to "Horiseon"
* Optomized index.html by implementing appropriate semantic elements such as Header, Footer, Nav, Section, article, aside, and main to the necessary locations.
* Updated & added alt attributes to images
* Deployed descriptive comments to  the index.html & style.css files
